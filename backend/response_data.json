  "albedo,team": "There are two recommended team setups for albedo to use, the Geobro or the quickshot team, which should i tell you about?",
  "albedo,normal attack": "A functional, albeit entirely standard set of autos. Chaining his normal attacks does not give very high damage. However, his charged attack can be cancelled by walk cancelling, which is double-tapping the W key. Thus, it is ideal to either N1CW or N2CW. The third auto loses damage compared to N2CW.",
  "albedo,elemental skill": "Albedo places a flower, which does damage in a minor AOE. Afterwards, every time an enemy takes damage, the flower creates a Transient bloom and deals extra damage. This can happen a maximum of once every 2 seconds. Each bloom has a 67% chance to produce a Geo particle. The procs can happen every 2s but due to lacking attack frequency you will usually average one proc every ~2.5s.",
  "albedo, elemental burst": "Albedo summons Geo crystals as an initial hit, damaging his enemies. Additionally, if the burst is performed within the range of a flower, Fatal Blossoms are created that damage nearby enemies. The fatal blossoms are pseudo-RNG, and have quadratic scaling. This means that one blossom is assigned to one enemy, and then when all enemies within the circle are accounted for, the rest are distributed randomly, but with a predisposition towards generating near an enemy.",
  "albedo, innate talent": "A crafting passive that can save you resin is always welcome. This passive competes with Mona’s passive which has a 25% chance to refund a material used. While it may, on its face, generate larger amounts of materials, in practice the additional number of crafts allowed by Mona makes them about equal, with the exact distribution depending on the amount of materials needed.",
  "albedo, ascension 1": "A decent damage buff that leads to an overall damage increase of about 13% for any proc that benefits from this ascension talent. However, given its requirements, don’t expect its uptime to be more than 50%.",
  "albedo, ascension 4": "This passive seems decent on paper as 125 EM is a sizeable amount of EM. However, as most teams are capable of running Kazuha or Sucrose, their ability to utilise the 4VV set makes them superior choices in most cases. While this isn’t an entirely useless ascension talent, it is certainly a niche one.",
  "albedo, 1 constellation": "The value of this constellation depends heavily upon the comp that Albedo is in. In a mono-Geo comp, Albedo has no use for this constellation. In some other teams, regardless of whether Albedo is working with an energy deficit, it can be a DPS loss to Burst with him and making his Burst irrelevant. However, in a comp where Albedo is the sole Geo in the team, his Burst is required, and there are no team energy generators like EMC or Raiden, this constellation is incredibly valuable.",
  "albedo, 2 constellation": "Unleashing Rite of Progeniture: Tectonic Tide consumes all stacks of Fatal Reckoning. Each stack of Fatal Reckoning consumed increases the DMG dealt by Fatal Blossoms and Rite of Progeniture: Tectonic Tide’s burst DMG by 30% of Albedo’s DEF.",
  "albedo, 3 constellation": "C3 is an upgrade to Albedo’s main damage source, his Elemental Skill. Nothing bad about this.",
  "albedo, 4 constellation": "Elevator memes aside, this constellation is pretty useless for Albedo. It’s only really useful when you pair Albedo with Xiao, or use dragonstrike comps.",
  "albedo, 5 constellation": "C5 is a much more niche con than C3, so this constellation sees a lot less benefit than C3. However, it does have places where it shines.",
  "albedo, 6 constellation": "C6 marginally strengthens Albedo’s capabilities as a sub-DPS by increasing the damage of his teammates. Note that just like the DMG% from Geo Resonance, this bonus only applies to units on field and does not snapshot, meaning that this constellation is only beneficial towards the carry of the team, and thus can be rather niche.",
  "geobro": "This comp plays to Albedo’s strengths, having strong off-field damage while allowing the carries to be on field and do their own thing. Albedo’s low gauge application on his skill here plays to his benefit, as he won’t eat gauge like a lot of other units. This comp especially works with Hu Tao or Xiao, but is really effective with carries that are relatively self reliant or only need one strict pair, and particularly carries who appreciate using Zhongli.",
  "quickshot": "A comp that minimises rotation duration to maximise damage. Due to the nature of Geo characters, and the tendency for them to have low cooldown duration bursts, it is ideal to run rotations with short durations. ",

  "aloy, team": "There are two recommended team setups for Aloy to use, the Permafreeze (on-field) or the Quickswap Melt DPS team, which should i tell you about?",
  "aloy, normal attack": "Aloy’s Normal and Charged Attacks are standard for those of a bow character. She has a 4-hit Normal Attack string, with the first hit being a multi-hit and the rest single. Her Charged Attack will deal Cryo damage when fully charged.Her Normal and Charged Attacks all have fairly average scalings. This Talent will generally only be used as a main DPS.",
  "aloy, elemental skill": "Aloy throws a Freeze Bomb in the targeted direction that explodes on impact and then splits into 6 Chillwater Bomblets that either explode on contact with an enemy or after a short delay. All explosions deal Cryo damage.When the Freeze Bomb or Bomblets hit opponents, they will deal Cryo damage, reduce the enemy’s Attack, and give Aloy one Coil stack. Aloy can gain one Coil stack every 0.1 seconds. These stacks last for 30 seconds after Aloy leaves the field. Aloy can also receive stacks while not on the field. Every Coil stack increases Aloy’s Normal Attack damage. When Aloy has 4 Coil stacks, all stacks are cleared and she will enter the Rushing Ice state. This state, denoted by a white mist around the active character, further increases Aloy’s Normal Attack damage and converts it to Cryo damage for 10 seconds. Even if another character has the white mist effect, their damage is not buffed or altered, the particle effect is only there to make the player aware that Rushing Ice is active for Aloy. While in this state, Aloy cannot receive additional Coil stacks. This skill has a cooldown of 20 seconds. Rushing Ice state does not end when you swap off Aloy within its duration.Frozen Wilds generates 5 Cryo particles.",
  "aloy, elemental burst": "Aloy throws a power cell filled with Cryo at the nearest enemy, then detonates it with an arrow, dealing AOE Cryo damage. This Burst is similar to Childe’s bow Burst in targeting, but it has a slightly larger AOE. Aloy’s Burst costs 40 energy and has a cooldown of 12 seconds. This is the bread and butter of Aloy’s kit, and it’s what makes her a decent Burst -DPS.",
  "aloy, innate talent": "When Aloy is in the party, animals who produce Fowl, Raw Meat or Chilled Meat will not be startled when approached.An excellent Talent for hunting, however once you kill one animal or get too close, the others will still run. ",
  "aloy, ascension 1": "When Aloy receives the Coil effect from Frozen Wilds, her ATK is increased by 16%, while nearby party members’ ATK is increased by 8%. This effect lasts 10 seconds.It’s a nice, straightforward buff to Aloy and her teammates that helps them hit a bit harder.",
  "aloy, ascension 4": "When Aloy is in the Rushing Ice state conferred by Frozen Wilds, her Cryo DMG Bonus increases by 3.5% every second. A maximum Cryo DMG bonus of 35% can be gained in this way.With this Talent, Quickswap DPS Aloy should burst after a few seconds of the Rushing Ice state duration, to make full use of the Cryo DMG bonus. As for Burst-DPS Aloy, although she does not reliably trigger Rushing Ice, it may occasionally happen while she is off-field, in which case she would benefit from this Talent.",
  "quickswap": "A Burst-DPS Aloy can generally fit in most teams as a quick fill in the flex slot. However, her relatively long Elemental Skill cooldown makes her suboptimal for some teams, such as Superconduct teams and certain Melt teams (for example Hu Tao and Bennett teams where they are Melting). If run in a Superconduct team, ensure there is a second Cryo unit such as Rosaria or Kaeya so they can cover with their Cryo application when Aloy’s Skill is down. Refer to your DPS character’s guide for more synergies.Burst-DPS Aloy can replace Diona in Freeze teams as a more damaging option, at the cost of increased comfort that Diona’s shielding, healing, and stamina reduction provide.",
  "Permafreeze": "Cryo Resonance is a must in this team for the free CRIT Rate. An Anemo unit must also be in the team to shred enemy resistances with 4 set Viridescent Venerer and pull in Aloy’s bombs so she can more easily obtain Coil stacks. Be wise with who you give TToDS buff to if you’re running Mona, Kokomi, Barbara or Sucrose. If running Xingqiu or Mona as the Hydro unit, make sure they have sufficient ER for consistent Burst uptime. Use your Cryo battery or Charged Attack on Aloy to have a Cryo aura to Swirl for the 4 set VV effect before using Aloy for damage. When skills are down, focus on getting them back. Use your Cryo battery to funnel particles to Aloy.Example rotation (assuming a team of Aloy, Diona, Xingqiu and Sucrose): Diona Hold E (to apply Cryo and shield) >  Diona Q (optional for healing) > Sucrose Q (for Cryo VV and grouping) > Xingqiu E > Xingqiu Q > Aloy E > Sucrose E (Cryo VV and grouping bombs) > Aloy N4 > Aloy Q",

Always aim to use the stacked up Arataki Kesagiri slashes (CA), rather than the slow and weak Saichimonji Slash. Superlative Superstrength stacks are indicated by the Oni mask floating on Itto’s back, which glows when the maximum number of stack is reached.",
  "itto, elemental skill": "This Skill is a burst of high damage, and is a noticeable portion of Itto’s damage. It’ll be covered during the Combos section, as well.",
  "itto, elemental burst": "This is the crux of Itto’s kit, as he relies on DEF to give him ATK through this Burst, as well as a Geo conversion on all his attacks. The RES decrease on Itto himself is mostly irrelevant, as he has high base DEF and will be tankier than most characters.A few things to note with Itto’s burst:   • It only snapshots the DEF to ATK conversion, while the rest is dynamic. This means that any buffs aside from DEF buffs that expire or happen during Itto’s burst will affect his DMG.   • Itto’s burst cannot be alt-swapped in without losing the buffs from Gorou, unless in special cases (see more here). It’s recommended to manually switch to Itto first, then activate his Burst once the buff indicator appears.",
  "itto, innate talent": "Itto is great for wood gathering, in addition to his fast NA string. Great unit for teapot fans. Any extra wood gained from this passive does not count towards the 2000 per day limit.",
  "itto, ascension 1": "Encourages you to get max Superlative Superstrength stacks before using them all at once in order to maximize the ATK SPD gain.  Also a good QoL passive, as it allows Itto to unleash his CAs faster without being interrupted, which can lead to DPS loss.",
  "itto, ascension 4": "Simply more damage to his Charged Attacks. Encourages building DEF% on him even more.",
  "itto, 1 constellation": "After using Royal Descent: Behold, Itto the Evil!, Arataki Itto gains 2 stacks of Superlative Superstrength. After 1s, Itto will gain 1 stack of Superlative Superstrength every 0.5s for 1.5s.Average damage gain over C0: 2%This constellation is particularly interesting. Its average damage gain over C0 is not very high, because it only adds a few slashes to Itto’s combo while taking out some Normal Attacks. However, due to buff uptimes, this constellation can end up being better than expected because more of the slashes happen earlier in his combo. This constellation will be discussed more in the Combo section of the guide.",
  "itto, 2 constellation": "After using Royal Descent: Behold, Itto the Evil!, each party member whose Element is Geo will decrease that skill’s CD by 1.5s and restore 6 Energy to Arataki Itto.CD can be decreased by up to 4.5s in this manner. Max 18 Energy can be restored in this manner.Average damage gain over previous constellation: 2.5%Average damage gain over C0: 4.5%  This constellation is purely QoL, with any damage increase coming from reduced ER requirements (if you can rearrange artifacts). Itto’s rotations already run over his Burst cooldown, so reducing it does not affect rotations at all. The Energy refund lowers ER requirements and allows for more offensive substats in artifacts, which is an increase in damage overall.",
  "itto, 3 constellation": "Increases the Level of Masatsu Zetsugi: Akaushi Burst! by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15.Average damage gain over previous constellation: 4%Average damage gain over C0: 9%This constellation slightly increases the damage dealt by Ushi, which is not insignificant but it is also not very large. Not a particularly impactful constellation one way or the other.",
  "itto, 4 constellation": "When the Raging Oni King state caused by Royal Descent: Behold, Itto the Evil! ends, all nearby party members gain 20% DEF and 20% ATK for 10s.Average damage gain over previous constellation: 5%* Average damage gain over C0: 14%This constellation is important to note because it only increases Itto’s damage from the second rotation onwards. The first time Itto uses his Burst in a particular Spiral Abyss floor, he will not gain any damage from this constellation, but any time after that he will gain the stated increase (as long as you use his Burst within 10 seconds, which you should be doing). This also buffs allies, so it is essentially a 4NO buff with an additional 20% DEF. A good constellation, if you aren’t already killing everything in the first rotation.",
  "itto, 5 constellation": "Increases the Level of Royal Descent: Behold, Itto the Evil! by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15.Average damage gain over previous constellation: 11%Average damage gain over C0: 27% (without C4 active: 20.5%)This constellation increases Itto’s Burst talent level, which increases the DEF to ATK conversion ratio. A rather large increase to Itto’s damage, but nothing particularly special about it, as it is a straightforward constellation.",
  "itto, 6 constellation": "Arataki Itto’s Charged Attacks deal +70% Crit DMG. Additionally, when he uses Arataki Kesagiri, he has a 50% chance to not consume stacks of Superlative Superstrength.Average damage gain over previous constellation: 24%Average damage gain over C0: 56% (without C4 active: 49%)Itto’s C6 is quite difficult to quantify. The CRIT DMG is very, very strong, especially when in combination with the second part of the effect to get many more Charged Attacks per Burst. However, the second part of the effect is completely RNG. Furthermore, sometimes, you might get no improvement from it as you will fail every single chance to save a stack. Sometimes, you might save a stack every single time. Because the number of stacks saved also means that it takes longer to get all of them out, it can also vastly change the combo and what you can fit in. Of course, Itto’s power at this level generally means most enemies will have died regardless. Overall, this constellation is quite strong, but it also makes Itto a lot less strategic and makes you rely quite significantly on RNG.",
  "triple-gea": "This team composition is the recommended go-to for Itto due to all the synergy it has. Itto appreciates the extra energy generated by having teammates of the same element, and Gorou’s buffs cap out at having 3 Geo members on the team. Albedo is highly recommended in the 3rd slot due to his consistent off-field damage alongside energy particles generation. The fourth slot is usually flexible, and does not require any particular unit, as Itto does not have anti-synergy with a majority of the cast due to the innate, non-reactive nature of the Geo element.Though strong, Triple Geo with Itto, like any other team, has its own drawbacks. The most obvious problem is the team’s difficulty with breaking elemental shields: Geo does not react with other elements like Pyro, Hydro or Cryo do. This, coupled with the fact that Itto’s NAs and CAs during his burst all apply 1U Geo, means that he by himself can struggle with taking down Abyss Lector’s or Herald’s shield. Fortunately, the flex fourth slot of the team can be a dedicated shield-breaker, making the team far from useless when dealing with shielded enemies. Triple Geo plus Zhongli, or Mono Geo, trades in healing and shield-breaking for comfort thanks to the high uptime on a strong shield, in addition to extra Geo RES shred. A rather straightforward team, with Itto and Albedo being the primary DMG dealers, and Gorou and Zhongli adding valuable buffs and protection. Also eases up ER requirements for Itto and Gorou.Rotation: Zhongli hold E → Gorou EQ → Albedo E → Itto Q combos",
  "others": "Itto unfortunately does not have a lot of team options outside of Triple Geo, given that he will perform best with teammates of the same element due to the reasons already discussed. However, this does not mean that players are discouraged to explore unconventional options. Players can opt for teams with Itto and another Geo unit, and two flex units that work off-field and can provide good utility or DMG, or mix and match for more fun teams. See some examples below:2.3 Spiral Abyss, Itto – Beidou from Aftermath#7658: https://youtu.be/R3pHhNWbE0k2.3 Spiral Abyss, Itto – Beidou from Akarin#8270: https://youtu.be/uPnDR94Ti4k",

This skill is Ayato’s primary source of damage. His Shunsuiken attacks are noticeably able to hit multiple ungrouped enemies in AoE. Something to note is that part of his Skill damage scaling off of HP means that he benefits less from ATK buffs than he would otherwise.

DPS Increase over C5: 19.3%Cumulative DPS Increase: 93.1%",
  "ayato, reaction soup": "A strong team made up of strong and synergistic units, especially in AoE, where Kazuha’s contribution through Swirls is greatly increased. Bennett provides a massive ATK buff and healing to the team as well as the Pyro application for Kazuha’s Burst to absorb off of. Kazuha, in turn, provides a DMG% buff, 4 VV, CC, and high-damage Swirls and Overloads. These Overloads are enabled by Fischl’s Electro application, with Ayato as a Hydro applicator to more easily maintain the Electro aura. Ayato is especially strong in this team compared to other Hydro units because of his off-field AoE Hydro application and quick bursts of damage that fit nicely into the quickswap-like playstyle of the team. Furthermore, the team already plays 24-25s rotations because of Fischl, meaning that Ayato’s desire for 24-25s rotations is not an issue. Something of note is that provided tight enough execution, Ayato can snapshot his Burst on Bennett’s Burst starting from the second rotation onwards.",
  "ayato, electro charged": "A varied team, usually involving Ayato as the on-field DPS while an Electro character deals damage usually from off-field. This Electro off-field DPS oftentimes has high Energy costs that require the use of an Electro battery.Despite the name, Electro-Charged itself is typically not the focus of this team, but rather merely a byproduct of the characters’ Elemental applications. However, Electro-charged is useful for maintaining both a Hydro and Electro aura, allowing the usage of weapons such as Lion’s Roar or making it easier to Swirl both Elements.",
  "ayato, vap": "Ayato’s Shunsuiken attacks can enable Xiangling’s Burst to Vaporize throughout the duration of his Takimeguri Kanka state, opening up the possibility for various Vaporize compositions. Ayato’s 24s+ rotations work well with Xiangling, allowing her to cast 2 Skills per Burst. This not only lowers her ER requirements through the additional Guoba’s Particles, but also allows her to make excellent use of Kitain Cross Spear to further lower her ER requirements. At the same time, Ayato occupying much of the field time means that little time is left to be spent using Bennett to battery Xiangling, leading to Xiangling having generally higher ER reqs in Ayato teams versus with other Hydro enablers.It is worth noting that because of his short Takimeguri Kanka duration and the RNG-based nature of his Burst’s Hydro application when lacking grouping, Ayato can often cause Xiangling to have worse Vaporize rates relative to certain other Hydro characters. This can be alleviated by certain teammates, as explained below.",
  "ayato, mono hydro": "Hyper is a loose classification of a number of teams that revolve around primarily buffing Ayato’s damage. Many of these teams overlap with teams that can be considered Mono Hydro, or teams focused on dealing raw damage rather than being Reaction-based, typically consisting of only Hydro, Geo, and Anemo units.While both team archetypes underperform the reaction-based teams described above, and Mono Hydro can come with a large opportunity cost by occupying multiple valuable Hydro applicators, they are still very much viable teams, especially with the many recent additions of on and off-field Hydro applicators. Further, their focus on Ayato’s personal damage means they scale particularly well with investment into him. A Mono Hydro team in which Ayato drives Yelan and Xingqiu while all three Hydro characters provide particles to one another. Zhongli provides defensive utility via his shield, as well as buffing through his Jade Shield’s RES Shred and potentially 4 Archaic Petra. Ayato casts his Burst after his first Skill to shorten rotation times; however, casting it at the beginning of the rotation changes little in the grand scheme of things.",
  "ayato, freeze": "Ayato is in a curious spot in regards to Freeze teams: while Freeze teams where Ayato acts as the on-field DPS are incredibly comfortable to play and arguably utilize his wide AoE and quadratic scaling the best by locking grouped enemies into place, they are rarely his most damaging choice of teams. Similarly, Ayato has value as a Burst DPS in providing off-field Hydro application in a range that most other Hydro units do not have, but is rarely the most damaging choice for that team. This team aims to make full use of the quadratic scaling of Ayato and Ganyu’s Burst through Venti’s powerful grouping. Therefore, it excels primarily in situations with many enemies that can be Frozen and pulled into the vortex of Venti’s Burst, and performs significantly worse outside of these conditions. Using Ganyu’s Burst before Venti’s Burst, followed immediately by Ayato’s Burst, ensures that Venti’s Burst reliably absorbs Cryo, even in subsequent rotations when Ayato’s Burst is still ongoing upon Venti’s Burst cast. Deviating from this sequence may result in inconsistent Cryo or Hydro absorption and thus unreliable Energy refund from Venti’s A4 passive, which may cause issues given this team’s relatively high Energy requirements. Venti ideally Normal Attacks, dashes, or jumps immediately after his second Skill cast to prematurely cancel its long animation, shortening and making smoother the rotation. In a single Skill rotation such as this, and without a second Hydro, Ayato runs into egregiously high ER requirements that significantly lower his damage. While a high-refine Amenoma Kageuchi and a slight addition to the rotation can remedy the problem, Ayato Bursting first in the rotation means that the Energy refund will only take effect from the second Burst onwards. Therefore, players can alternatively opt to use Ayato’s Burst every other rotation. This team has high enough Freeze uptime that it is possible to comfortably play it without a healer or dedicated defensive unit. Nonetheless, players can choose to run Jean/Sayu or Diona in place of Kazuha or Kaeya, respectively.",
  "ayato, focus": "As a main DPS: 1st priority: Elemental Skill. 2nd priority: Elemental Burst. 3rd priority: Normal Attack.  As a Sub-DPS:  1st priority: Elemental Burst. 2nd priority: Elemental Skil. 3rd priority: Normal Attack.",

  "kazuha, normal attack": "Kazuha’s normal attack, Garyuu Bladework, hits 8 times, with the third attack in his normal attack string hitting twice and the fifth attack hitting 3 times.As Kazuha mostly functions as a sub-DPS/support unit who doesn’t use his normal attacks, this talent isn’t very important to his kit in most scenarios. While Kazuha can function as a main DPS, you’ll typically find that he will offer more to teams as a support and sub-DPS than as a main DPS unit.However, it is worth mentioning that Midare Ranzan (the name for Kazuha’s anemo-infused plunge attack) is affected by his talent multiplier on his plunge attack, so even as a Sub-DPS, Kazuha should level his normal attack talent for extra damage, with the damage gain obtained from leveling his normal attack about equal to or slightly more than the damage gain obtained from leveling his elemental skill talent (unless C6).",
  "kazuha, elemental skill": "Kazuha’s elemental skill, Chihayaburu, is his main CC tool. Using this skill will pull enemies in towards Kazuha and launch Kazuha into the air. After being launched, Kazuha can perform a special plunging attack called Midare Ranzan, which will deal anemo damage and is affected by Kazuha’s normal attack talent; this attack’s anemo infusion cannot be overridden by another element (i.e. through Bennett’s sixth constellation or through Chongyun’s skill) and is not considered skill damage. The skill will also absorb an element, which will allow Kazuha to also deal damage aligned to the absorbed element after plunging. This allows Kazuha to swirl twice against a single enemy – once on the initial damage dealt by the skill, and once during Midare Ranzan. After plunging, Kazuha will create an anemo vortex, which sucks in enemies for a short period after the plunge ends.This skill can be tapped or held; the main differences between the two variants of the skill are the damage that they do, the range of the pulling effect, the cooldown of the skill, and the energy generation. The Hold version of the skill has larger range, longer cooldown, more damage, and higher energy generation than the tap version of the skill. The hold version of the skill also takes slightly longer to perform, although the difference isn’t too significant. Which version of his skill Kazuha uses depends on a variety of factors, including his team, weapon, constellations, and more. For example, if Kazuha has his first constellation active, he can use his hold E before using his burst, as the longer cooldown on his hold E won’t matter since the skill cooldown will be reset. Kazuha can also use his Hold E if using the Sacrificial Sword, as the skill will immediately be reset; this allows Kazuha to generate more energy.Here’s a full breakdown of a comparison between the two versions of his skill:",
  "kazuha, elemental burst": "Kazuha’s Elemental Burst, Kazuha Slash, is a 60 energy cost burst which creates a field that can absorb an element, dealing both Anemo and the absorbed element’s damage in a large AOE. When casting his burst, Kazuha will first perform a large slash that deals Anemo DMG, then leave a field which stays for 8 seconds. Kazuha’s burst will deal 5 ticks of absorbed element and anemo damage, allowing him to constantly apply an element to the enemy. The damage dealt by each tick is snapshotted on burst cast.Kazuha’s elemental burst has a certain infusion priority; if multiple elements are present, Kazuha’s burst will prioritize Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo. Knowledge of this infusion priority can allow players to control what element Kazuha infuses, increasing his support capability. It is also important to mention that Kazuha’s initial slash applies 2U anemo, which can be useful for clearing elemental auras to perform double shred/double VV setups or for double swirling, such as in EC or Freeze teams.",
  "kazuha, innate talent": "During this state, performing a plunge attack within 10 seconds (and therefore trigger the Midare Ranzan special effect) will deal an additional 200% Attack as plunge damage with the same element it absorbed in the Swirl.",
  "kazuha, ascension 1": "Kazuha’s Ascension 1 talent, Soumon Swordsmanship, deals 200% of the infused elemental damage when plunging if Kazuha’s elemental skill infuses an element. This provides Kazuha with some extra damage, as well as providing him with an additional swirl on his skill (if Midare Ranzan is triggered). The absorbed elemental damage is dealt before Midare Ranzan occurs, which allows Midare Ranzan to swirl even without pre-existing aura on enemies. The applied aura from Soumon Swordsmanship can also react with existing auras on enemies (if it wasn’t cleared by Kazuha’s elemental skill), potentially resulting in the loss of a swirl if the gauge applied by Soumon Swordsmanship is large enough to clear the pre-existing aura.",
  "kazuha, ascension 4": "Kazuha’s Ascension 4 Talent is one of the core elements of his support capability. When triggering a swirl, Kazuha will give himself and his teammates an Elemental DMG% bonus for the swirled element, with the strength of the buff based on Kazuha’s elemental mastery stat. For example, if Kazuha swirls hydro, he will provide his teammates with a hydro buff. This passive works off-field, allowing Kazuha to continuously provide an elemental bonus with his elemental burst. Kazuha’s Ascension 4 talent can be used in conjunction with the Viridescent Venerer set bonus to grant a very large buff to team members. In teams where multiple teammates of different elements are dealing a significant amount of damage (for example, the National Team, which is composed of Xingqiu, Xiangling, Bennett, and a flexible fourth team member), it’s even possible for Kazuha to buff both elements and shred resistance to both elements through precise rotations. Proper usage of this talent is what truly makes or breaks Kazuha’s supporting capability.",
  "kazuha, 1 constellation": "Decreases Chihayaburu’s CD by 10%. Using Kazuha Slash resets the CD of Chihayaburu.Kazuha’s first constellation, Scarlet Hills, allows him to use less energy recharge in his kit, as it gives him an extra cast of his elemental skill after using his burst. This allows him to use more Elemental Mastery in place of ER; however, it runs into the same problem as the Sacrificial Sword: the more time that Kazuha spends on-field casting his elemental skill, the more field time Kazuha takes away from the team’s other units. This issue can be further compounded by the fact that Kazuha’s A4 buff lasts for only 8 seconds, meaning that any units which take advantage of Kazuha’s A4 buff will have their buff uptime cut short by Kazuha’s skill usage (assuming that Kazuha’s elemental skill usage does not refresh the A4 buff, which can occur in some rotations where multiple elements are being applied to enemies). Kazuha’s C1 isn’t bad by any means, but players should recognize that using the additional skill cast that it grants can be detrimental in some situations, and should try to work around those situations.",
  "kazuha, 2 constellation": "The Autumn Whirlwind field created by Kazuha Slash has the following effects:Increases Kaedehara Kazuha’s own Elemental Mastery by 200 for its duration.Increases the Elemental Mastery of characters within the field by 200.The Elemental Mastery-increasing effects of this Constellation do not stack.Kazuha’s second constellation, Yamaarashi Tailwind, makes him strictly better at supporting reaction-reliant units, like Melt Ganyu and Vape Diluc, than Sucrose. His C2 buff alone is competitive with Sucrose’s EM buff (with Sucrose ahead if she can trigger her A1 passive in addition to her A4 passive and has more than 750 EM, or if she possesses more than 1000 EM). Sucrose gets the benefit of being able to use Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers, but this is more than matched by Kazuha’s A4 Elemental DMG% team buff (if Kazuha is using EM artifacts). Most units will gain more damage from Elemental DMG% than ATK%, especially if those units are already being buffed by Bennett or by other external sources of ATK. While Sucrose herself also possesses a source of Elemental DMG% through her C6, the method of activating the buff can be unreliable, and Sucrose’s elemental burst has its own drawbacks (sometimes knocking enemies away from each other, high energy cost) that make it less reliable than Kazuha’s Elemental DMG% bonus. This all doesn’t even account for Kazuha’s ability to double-buff units with specific rotations (such as buffing both Childe and Xiangling in a Xiangling/Childe Reverse Vape team, which neither TTDS nor Sucrose’s C6 can do) or Kazuha’s greater personal damage as a support.

The first part of this constellation can be used in conjunction with Kazuha’s first constellation to grant Kazuha a large amount of energy at once, allowing him to run even less energy recharge in exchange for using more damage-focused stats. While the gliding effect of Kazuha’s fourth constellation has little practical use in combat, it can actually be useful outside of combat. The Spiral Abyss possesses a small slanted pillar that Kazuha can jump off of to glide, which allows Kazuha to (slowly) recharge his energy in-between abyss floors. The gliding ability can also be useful in the overworld, where Kazuha will be gliding to travel between locations pretty frequently. ",
  "kazuha, 5 constellation": "Increases the Level of Manyou no Ittou by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15.",

Additionally, each point of Elemental Mastery will increase the DMG dealt by Kaedehara Kazuha’s Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks by 0.2%.Kazuha’s Constellation 6 allows him to function much better as an on-field DPS unit. As an on-field DPS at Constellation 6, Kazuha’s best build becomes more of a toss-up. His ATK/Anemo/Crit build pulls ahead of his EM/EM/EM build by about 6%, with this number increasing with the amount of external buffs Kazuha gets – with Bennett’s buffs, Kazuha’s ATK/Anemo/Crit build is about 11% better than his EM/EM/EM build. As such, the ATK/Anemo/Crit is competitive with EM/EM/EM in single-target situations, and can still be competitive in multi-target situations (without a significant amount of chain reactions). Generally, Kazuha’s best build at C6 depends on his teammates; if Kazuha makes up the main portion of his team’s damage, he should use ATK/Anemo/CR in single target situations and multi-target situations without chain reactions or without a significant number of them, while, if Kazuha does not make up a significant portion of his team’s damage, an EM/EM/EM build may be more conducive to dealing more team damage. Kazuha’s EM/EM/EM build may also be better at C6 if his teammates can easily set up a large amount of chain reactions for him. Ultimately, the choice of which build to go with at C6 is highly dependent on the player and their preferred playstyle. ",
  "kazuha, melt": "Kazuha can function as a good replacement for Xiangling in a Ganyu Melt team, which makes Ganyu’s two most well-known teams – Morgana and Ganyu/Kazuha Melt – both teams which use three five star units. Xiangling typically has issues charging her burst in a Ganyu melt team, and needs high amounts of Energy Recharge and access to a significant amount of HP particles to reliably fund her burst off cooldown. Xiangling also has drawbacks for each of her methods of pyro application: her pyronado revolves around the active character, requiring Ganyu to hug enemies, and Guoba can struggle to hit multiple targets (or even hit anyone at all). Kazuha avoids both of these issues by having a lower cost burst that is easier to fund, while also applying pyro in a massive area. Kazuha also buffs Ganyu through the 4-piece VV artifact set and his A4 passive, which is something that Xiangling cannot do. While Xiangling’s pyronado will stay on-field for longer, Kazuha’s buffs will strengthen each of Ganyu’s charged shots by at least 30%. As such, even though Ganyu will typically perform less charged shots in a Kazuha team than a Xiangling team, her (and her new team’s) overall DPS can be much higher.",
  "kazuha, vap": "In this team, Kazuha functions as a buffer for both Xiangling and Childe. With the right rotation, he can buff both Childe’s hydro attacks and Xiangling’s pyro attacks, although the rotation can be a bit difficult to perform. While the buff utility that he offers to the team is around the same level (or even possibly lower) as the utility that Sucrose can offer to the team, his grouping ability is greater than Sucrose’s, which is invaluable to the team as Childe gains quadratic scaling on his normal attacks due to riptide when enemies are grouped.There are many possible setups for this; one possible rotation is as follows:Childe Skill Stance ChangeBennett BurstKazuha Hold Skill > PlungeKazuha BurstXiangling SkillXiangling BurstChilde MeleeAnother rotation that infuses Kazuha’s burst with Hydro is as follows:Childe Skill Stance Change (apply hydro to enemy)Kazuha Burst (infuse hydro)Bennett SkillBennett BurstKazuha Hold SkillXiangling SkillXiangling BurstChilde MeleeA third possible rotation that utilizes a charged shot is as follows:Childe Charged ShotKazuha BurstBennett SkillBennett BurstKazuha Hold Skill > PlungeXiangling SkillXiangling BurstChilde MeleeThe timing on these rotations vary in difficulty, but it is recommended to practice whichever one you choose to use a few times before utilizing it in combat.",
  "kazuha, electro charged": "Venti and Kazuha can play together well in an Electro-Charged team with Fischl and Kokomi. Kazuha can make use of the 4-piece thundering fury artifact set in this team if Venti is using the 4-piece Viridescent Venerer artifact set. In this team, all team members should simply be using their skills and bursts off cooldown; there isn’t a particular “set rotation,” making the team very easy to play.This team is only recommended to use in multitarget scenarios because of the potential for chain reactions in AOE, which both allows the team to deal more damage and allows Kazuha to more easily trigger the 4TF artifact set bonus.",
  "kazuha, freeze": "Freeze teams are one place where Kazuha can shine as a support. Since the freeze reaction is not affected by Elemental Mastery, Sucrose provides no benefit to freeze teams, and in freeze teams like Kaeya Permafreeze and Rosaria permafreeze, enemies need to remain on the ground so that Kaeya and Rosaria can hit them, rendering Venti less useful in team comps. Kazuha can buff both Cryo and Hydro easily due to his multiple 2U anemo applications, which make it easier to trigger double swirls on frozen with underlying hydro. (For an explanation of how double swirls work, check out this link.) The team members for Kazuha Freeze teams are generally quite flexible due to the similarity of many cryo units in Genshin. For example, Rosaria can substitute for Kaeya and vice versa.Example Teams:Ayaka Freeze (Ayaka/Rosaria/Kokomi/Kazuha)Kaeya/Rosaria Freeze (Kaeya/Rosaria/Xingqiu/Kazuha)Ayaka/Ganyu Freeze (Ayaka/Ganyu/Kokomi/Kazuha)",
